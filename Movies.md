# Movie Project

A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale
The topic we are choosing to study is the international film and entertainment industry. We chose this topic because of a shared interest in film and the availability of data.

A link to your dataset(s) and a screenshot of the metadata if it exists.

A sketch of the final design     
Our three views will be the following:

1. An interactive film map displaying the number of films produced in different countries. We intend to have multiple filters for genre and rating. In addition, each marker will have a tooltip displaying total gross and total budget of the films produced in that country. 

2. A line graph displaying the y -axis as gross and x-axis as year with a dynamic parameter line that toggles between rating and genre. 

3. This view is to display data specifically for directors. Users should be able to query a table that will show director data matched with the entire dataset. For exmaple, if a user wanted to see which movies James Cameron directed, how much each film grossed, etc. they should be able to do this within this view.
